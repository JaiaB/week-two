# Week Two - RA
Hi ðŸ‘‹ this week we created 4 projects. We divided the projects in branches 

The main branch has a very simple page about me. 

The second branch has an HTML tables assignment

The third branch has an HTML form styled with CSS and has basic validation from the user on submission

The fourth branch is an upgraded version of the mock bakery page from week one. In it, I added a form and styled accordingly.

Thanks for stopping by!
